# battery-alert-i3

By default there is no low battery alert support in i3 Manjaro community
edition due to which often times my system goes down because i didn't get
any alert on low battery.


## Usage
```
$ chmod +x setup.sh
$ sudo ./setup.sh
```
An alert notification will be thrown if battery status is less than 15%
